### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm a creative programmer, media artist and technologist from Germany.

In 2016 I got my masters degree at the University of Koblenz in Computational Visualistics, a computer science program with a special focus on computer graphics and image processing mixed with courses from interdisciplinary fields such as art history, drawing and media art.

I write code to connect technology with creative disciplines, build generative art and interactive visual systems. I'm part of a local light artist collective called Pendeloque, which is performing mainly in the area of Mannheim and Heidelberg.
