## Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer & creative technologist from Germany.

In 2016 I got my masters degree at the University of Koblenz in Computational Visualistics, a computer science program with a special focus on computer graphics and image processing mixed with courses from interdisciplinary fields such as art history, drawing and media art.
