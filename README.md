## Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer, generative artist and creative technologist from Germany.

In 2016 I got my masters degree at the University of Koblenz in Computational Visualistics, a computer science program with a special focus on computer graphics and image processing mixed with courses from interdisciplinary fields such as art history, drawing and media art.

My interest lies in connecting technology with creative disciplines. I love to build generative art and interactive visual systems. I am a member of a hobbyists light artist collective [Pendeloque](https://www.pendeloque.de/), which mainly performs in the area of Mannheim and Heidelberg.
